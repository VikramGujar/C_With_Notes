            <h2>Introduction to C</h2>
            <p>C is a:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High level / middle level programming language.</li>
                <li>Compiler-based programming language.</li>
                <li>Procedure-oriented programming language (POPs).</li>
                <li>General-purpose programming language.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="program-software">
            <h2>What is a Program?</h2>
            <p>Set of instructions is called a program.</p>
            <h2>What is Software?</h2>
            <p>Set of programs is called software. We have two types of software:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>System software (e.g., OS, device drivers, translators)</li>
                <li>Application software (e.g., WhatsApp, PhonePe, IRCTC)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="language">
            <h2>What is a Language?</h2>
            <p>Languages are used to communicate with others. For example, human languages like Telugu, English, Hindi, Marathi are used for human communication. But to communicate with machines, we use programming languages like C, C++, Java, .NET, Python, Go, R, etc.</p>
            <p>Computer languages are divided into three types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine language: Created with binary code (e.g., 11100010).</li>
                <li>Low-level / assembly language: Created with English-like shortcuts called mnemonics (e.g., gd mrg, sub, add).</li>
                <li>High-level language: Created with simple English (e.g., good morning, subject, address).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="translator">
            <h2>What is a Translator?</h2>
            <p>Translators convert source code (in English) to binary code that computers can understand. Types of translators include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compiler: Converts the total program into binary code at once, leaving error lines.</li>
                <li>Interpreter: Checks the program line by line.</li>
                <li>Assembler: Converts low-level programs to binary code. Similar to a compiler.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In C & C++, compilers are used. In Java, .NET, and Python, both compilers and interpreters are used, making them compiler-based interpreted languages.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="paradigm">
            <h2>What is a Programming Paradigm?</h2>
            <p>Every programming language has a structure with specific rules and regulations, called a programming paradigm.</p>
            <p>Before C language, we had monolithic programming paradigms, where the entire application was designed with a single program. This made it difficult to find errors, increased memory usage, and reduced performance.</p>
            <p>To address these issues, the procedure-oriented programming structure (POPs) was introduced, where a big program is divided into smaller modules or procedures.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of POP:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Modularity: Dividing a big program into small modules according to the project requirement.</li>
                <li>Simplicity: Easy to read and understand.</li>
                <li>Reusability: Write once, use many times.</li>
                <li>Efficiency: High performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantage of POP:</h3>
            <p>The data is public, meaning any function can access the data from anywhere.</p>
            <p>C is a POP language, while C++ & Python are multi-paradigm languages supporting both POP and OOP.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="general-purpose">
            <h2>Why is C a General-Purpose Language?</h2>
            <p>C can be used to develop various types of software, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)</li>
                <li>Editors (e.g., Notepad, WordPad, MS Word)</li>
                <li>Translators (e.g., Compiler, Interpreter, Assembler)</li>
                <li>Commercial applications (e.g., Hotel, College, Supermarket programs)</li>
                <li>Databases (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB)</li>
                <li>Device drivers (e.g., Audio, Video, Printer, USB drivers)</li>
                <li>Embedded applications</li>
                <li>Mobile and PC games</li>
                <li>Media players (e.g., VLC, MX Player, Windows Media Player)</li>
                <li>Antivirus (e.g., Avast, NOD, McAfee)</li>
                <li>Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)</li>
                <li>Standalone applications</li>
            </ul>
