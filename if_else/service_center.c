// * This service center only accepts 2 wheeler ,3 wheeler & 4 wheeler . If any other vehicle 

// came to you , you have to show a message that "this service center is not accepting

// other than 2 wheeler, 3 wheeler and 4 wheeler".



// * If the vehicle is 2 ,3 & 4 only then you have to ask the user what is the age of the vehicle.



// * If the age your vehicle is above 8 months then only accept the service center 

// otherwise you have to show a message that "your vehicle servie will done after a while".



// * If the vehicle age is greater than 8 months then show options to the user on the console
// * Options:



// 1)Enter 1 for tyre problem

// 2)Enter 2 for fuel problem

// 3)Enter 3 for engine issue

// 4)Enter 4 for general services



// * If the user enter 1 as input so it is tyre problem statement so you have to show a message "how many tyres you are facing the issue ?", based on the issue on the no of tyres,

// generate the bill.
